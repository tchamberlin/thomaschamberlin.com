First attempt at a rocking chair design!

Here it is, complete with our favorite creepy dude (for scale):

And here it is, blissfully in his absence:

Based on these `ergonomic guidelines <http://ergo.human.cornell.edu/DEA3250Flipbook/DEA3250notes/sitting.html>`_ I found, I went with a 5° seat angle, 10° back angle. and this information on `rocker radius sizing <http://www.rockingchairuniversity.com/rocker-radius.html>`_. (with respect to vertical).

I avoided fancy angles here since it is the first draft. In the future I might have the seat/rockers taper towards the back -- not sure if there's an actual purpose to that other than aesthetics.

As always, here's the model. Click on this to view it interactively. It can also be downloaded and examined more closely in SketchUp, if you're into that sort of thing:
