Software

Construction
------------

Software used in my construction endeavors:

- `SketchUp <https://www.sketchup.com/products/sketchup-free>`_: I use this for all of my modeling/prototyping. It's quick, easy, and free
- `Kerkythea <http://www.kerkythea.net/cms/>`_: I use this for rendering the images I post up. Really no idea what I'm doing still, but it does the job

Website
-------

Software used to build this website:

- `Pelican <http://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/>`_: This is a static site generator; I use it to build this website. Super straightforward to use
- `Visual Studio Code <https://code.visualstudio.com/>`_: I recently switched over from Sublime Text and I've been quite happy so far

Hardware
========

I know it sucks looking at a build log that doesn't tell you what tools were used, so here it is. You really don't need much:

- `Ridgid Impact Driver R86036K <https://smile.amazon.com/Ridgid-R86036K-Stealth-Brushless-Driver/dp/B01ESFUPT8>`_
- `Bosch Jigsaw JS470E <https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B004323NPK>`_
- `Bosch Random Orbit Sander ROS20VSC <https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BD5G9VA>`_
