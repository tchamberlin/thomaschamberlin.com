About Me
########

:slug: about

I'm a software engineer working at the `Green Bank Observatory <https://greenbankobservatory.org/>`_, where I help people look at space. And sometimes I make websites (but not that one).

Projects
========

In my free time I like to build things. I've found a lot of great resources along the way; hopefully this will prove useful to someone at some point. All of the content here `is free <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>`_, and I'm trying to focus on reproducibility for each of my build logs.

Every one of my projects is prototyped in a CAD program (currently SketchUp, but that could change), and I'll be providing the models alongside or in advance of the build log.
