:summary: Couches for home theater system

I currently have a home theater setup in my living room. However, the room is not well-suited for it at all, so it's been quite the endeavor. I have one wall covered by the screen, another covered by windows, and another angled awkwardly in relation to the screen. That leaves the back wall for viewing movies.

Currently I have two couches along the back wall, each angled across a corner there. But they don't really fit very well and it leaves a lot of wasted space behind them. So, I'd like to build a couch that covers the entirety of the back wall.

Additionally I'd like to place a second couch along the "awkward viewing" wall, but be able to relocate it in order to watch movies. This means I'll need to loft the back couch -- sort of like stadium seating.

Still in the planning phases of this, but I think I can attach the legs of the back couch on axles so that it can be lofted up/down when needed. More images incoming shortly, but this should give a general idea at least:

As always, here's the model. Click on this to view it interactively. It can also be downloaded and examined more closely in SketchUp, if you're into that sort of thing:

.. raw:: html

    <div width="100%">
    <iframe
        src="https://3dwarehouse.sketchup.com/embed.html?mid=53378115-59cc-45fc-9232-4ba3dde4b4b1"
        frameborder="0"
        scrolling="no"
        marginheight="0"
        marginwidth="0"
        width="100%"
        height="326"
        allowfullscreen
    ></iframe>
    </div>
