:summary: Indoor garden, round 2

I got started with the indoor garden a little over a year ago. I'll make a post about that at some point soon, but I'll need to dig up the pictures.

Below is the plan for the next iteration. I currently have the three benches and the vertical H-frame built; pictures coming soon. The rest is awaiting the next burst of motivation...
